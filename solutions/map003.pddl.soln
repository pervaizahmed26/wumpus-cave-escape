; Placeholder PDDL solution for Wumpus Cave Escape
; In a real implementation, this would be generated by a PDDL planner
; like Fast-Forward (FF), Fast-Downward, or similar
; This solution assumes agent starts at (2,2) and escapes north

(walk agent loc_2_2 loc_1_2 north)
(walk agent loc_1_2 loc_0_2 north)
(walk agent loc_0_2 loc_-1_2 north)
